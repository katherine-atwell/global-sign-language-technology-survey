# Surveying Global Perspectives on Sign Language Technologies
Katherine Atwell and Malihe Alikhani

We thank you very much for your interest in our survey! Our goal is to survey deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals around the world regarding their perspectives on deafness, sign language technologies, and policy. This survey should take 10-15 minutes to complete, and does not collect emails or any other personal identifiers. 

Please feel free to share this sheet, or these links, to any members of the deaf and hard of hearing community in your network! We have the survey available in English, Spanish, French, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified), Turkish, Farsi, Arabic, and Hindi. Further, if you are in need of an interpreter to complete the survey, please reach out to Katherine Atwell at atwell.ka@northeastern.edu and we’ll do our best to meet your request. Please note that, although we will do our best, we may not be able to meet all requests due to the budget and logistics around providing interpretations.
